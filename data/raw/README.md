# Titanic CSV

Alternative: Load from CSV file instead of seaborn.

Download titanic.csv from: <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/blob/master/titanic.csvv>

Save it to project data/raw folder.

NOTE: The CSV file is not exactly the same as the Seaborn version.

- CSV includes a `year` column (2007, 2008, 2009)
- Seaborn version does not include `year`

It is included here for visual inspection and/or opening in Excel as you like.
